            <h2 id="h2">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li>
                <li>
                    1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                    Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>

                <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
                    helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
                    me."</li>
                <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by
                    Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                    pest-resistent plants</li>
                <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
                    the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,
                    and other applied science. </li>
                <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li>
                <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
                    Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
                    climate on Earth. </li>
            </ul>
